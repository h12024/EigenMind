In this project, I have developed a deep learning pipeline utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human actions in an input video with high accuracy. The model is trained on the UCF50 Action Recognition dataset, leveraging its diverse set of labeled activities to enhance generalization. The system processes video frames, extracts spatial-temporal features, and predicts the corresponding action category. The final output is presented as an annotated video, where the predicted action is seamlessly overlaid onto the visual content, offering an intuitive and interpretable result.
